Matrices are basically a two or more dimensional array.

1-D Array could be represented as vector :
    eg : [1,2,3]

Matrix is 2 or more dimensional array :
    eg : [[0,1,2]
          [3,4,5]
          [6,7,8]]
    This is a matrix of size m*n (3*3)

Covers Fundamental matrix operations    :
    1. Multiplication of Matrices
    2. Addition of Matrices
    3. Subtraction of Matrices
    4. Division of Matrices

diag function :
    1. If the input to a diag function is a vector, the output will be matrix
        eg : np.diag([1,2,3])
             Output :   [1, 0, 0
                         0, 2, 0
                         0, 0, 3]
    2. If the input to diag function is a matrix, the output will be a vector
        eg : np.diag([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]])
             Output :   [1, 5, 9]
