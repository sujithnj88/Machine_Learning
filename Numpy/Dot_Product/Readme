Let's perform dot operation on two vectors a and b
Link to reference on Vectors    :   https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors-dot-product.html


a.b =  |a| × |b| × cos(θ)
    Where:
        |a| is the magnitude (length) of vector a
        |b| is the magnitude (length) of vector b
         θ is the angle between a and b
    Note    :   When two vectors are at right angles to each other the dot product is zero. (cos(90) = 0)

a.b = aTb
