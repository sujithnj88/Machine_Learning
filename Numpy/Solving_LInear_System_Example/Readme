A linear system is a mathematical model of a system based on the use of a linear operator.
Linear systems typically exhibit features and properties that are much simpler than the nonlinear case.

Problem Statement   :
    The admission fee at a fair is 1.5$ for children and 4.0$ for adults.
    On a certain day, 2200 people enter the fair, and 5050$ is collected.
    How many children and how many adults attended the fair ?

Problem Solving Method  :
    x1 + x2 = 2200
    1.5x1 + 4x2 = 5500

Linear System in Matrix Form    :
    x = [x1,x2]
    a = [[1,1]
         [1.5,4]]
    b = [2200,5050]
    ax = b

Solution    :
    x1 + x2  = 2200
 1.5x1 + 4x2 = 5050
 ___________________
 0.5x1 + 3x2 = 2850

 0.5x1 = 2850 - 3x2
       = 2850 - 3(2200-x1)
       = 2850 - 6600 + 3x1
       = -3750 + 3x1
 2.5x1 = 3750
 x1 = 3750 / 2.5 => 1500
 x2 = 2200 - x1 => 2200 - 1500 => 700

 Number of Children : 1500
 Number of Adult    : 700
